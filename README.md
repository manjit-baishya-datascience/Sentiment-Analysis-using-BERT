# **Overview**
Sentiment Analysis of Twitter comments is crucial for understanding public opinion, detecting trends, and improving user engagement. This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a powerful deep learning model for Natural Language Processing (NLP).

# **Project Structure**
This project is organized into several key components:

- **Data**: A dataset of Twitter comments labeled with sentiment categories.
- **Preprocessing**: Steps to clean and prepare the text data for modeling.
- **Modeling**: Fine-tuning BERT for sentiment classification.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the trained model.
- **Pipeline**: A complete pipeline from data preprocessing to sentiment prediction.
- **Testing**: Examples of model predictions on new, unseen comments.

# **Data**
The dataset contains two main columns:

- **Text**: The actual Twitter comment.
- **Sentiment**: The label indicating the sentiment of the comment (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral).

The data is loaded from a CSV file and explored to understand its structure and distribution.

# **Data Preprocessing**
Effective preprocessing is essential for training an accurate sentiment analysis model. The preprocessing steps include:

- **Lowercasing**: Converts all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
- **Removing Special Characters**: Eliminates unnecessary symbols, punctuation, and numbers.
- **Tokenization**: Splits text into individual words or subwords to process the language effectively.
- **Removing Stop Words**: Filters out common words that do not contribute much to sentiment classification.
- **Lemmatization**: Reduces words to their root form to treat variations as the same.
- **Padding & Truncation**: Ensures uniform input length for BERT by padding short texts and truncating long ones.

# **Modeling**
The preprocessed data is used to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment analysis.

Key steps in modeling:

- **Tokenization**: The text is converted into numerical tokens using the BERT tokenizer.
- **Input Formatting**: The input is structured to match BERT's requirements (tokenized text, attention masks, etc.).
- **Fine-Tuning BERT**: The model is trained on labeled Twitter comments for sentiment classification.
- **Training Optimization**: The Adam optimizer and a learning rate scheduler are used to improve performance.

# **Evaluation**
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: Evaluates the balance between positive and negative classifications.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes how well the model distinguishes between sentiment classes.

# **Pipeline**
A complete pipeline is implemented to automate sentiment analysis, from data preprocessing to final predictions. This pipeline can be used for analyzing real-time Twitter data.

# **Testing the Model**
The trained model is tested with various sample Twitter comments to demonstrate its effectiveness. 

Example Predictions:

- **Tweet:** "I absolutely love this new phone! The camera is amazing."
  - **Predicted Sentiment:** Positive
- **Tweet:** "The service was terrible. I’m never coming back!"
  - **Predicted Sentiment:** Negative
- **Tweet:** "The update is okay, but I don’t see much difference."
  - **Predicted Sentiment:** Neutral

# **Conclusion**
This project successfully implements sentiment analysis using BERT on Twitter comments. The fine-tuned model provides accurate sentiment classification, making it a valuable tool for social media analysis.
